<p> This is a project I developed using Django for aid management of internally displaced people (IDP) sheltered under Mekelle City Administration.
The project has the following features:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Registers new arriving IDPs including family mambers and stores important authtentication certificates such as birth, marriage, medical and other certificates.
  <li> Since there seven subcities in Mekelle city, it checks if there an IDP has registered in more than one subcity, thereby preventing some cheaters from taking aid in more than one subcity. </li>
  <li> When new aid arrives it makes sure IDPs are selected based on who received aid from previous rounds and gives priorities by taking into account factors such as number of children, number of female
      members, elderly, and critically sick members. </li>
</ul>
